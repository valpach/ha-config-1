# My [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) Config

My HA installation runs on a Pi 3 with the following:

Software
--------
* [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv)
* [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) *for Apple HomeKit Support*

* [PiVPN](http://www.pivpn.io/) *for VPN into my house from anywhere*
* [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) *for the SSL on my HA domain*

Hardware
--------
* 1 x [Foscam FI8918W](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0046710G6) for a PTZ camera in my toddler's room which I've then configured using HA scripts to allow me to point at three different locations in the room
